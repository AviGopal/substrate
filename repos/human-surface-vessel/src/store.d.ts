/**
 * In-memory store for the substrate's human surface.
 *
 * Record semantics are inherited verbatim from stateful-ui-vessel, which this
 * vessel replaces:
 *   - panels       (substrate-authored UI artifacts)
 *   - feedback     (operator answers/reactions/dismisses on asks)
 *   - observations (behavioural telemetry — click/dwell/focus/scroll)
 *   - events       (interactorEvent — structured for upstream learning)
 *   - asserts      (interactorAssertion — operator-typed substrate-bound facts)
 *   - attachments  (interactorAttachment — operator-supplied references)
 *
 * Every record carries `visibility: "public" | "operator_only"`. Public records
 * may flow into the substrate's LLM context; operator_only records stay in the
 * pool and downstream filters must redact them.
 *
 * No persistence — a restart clears every store.
