/**
 * Discovery registration.
 *
 * THE FLAT-PAYLOAD TRAP: discovery-vessel's `RegistryStore.register` reads the
 * resolve contract fields (`resolve_endpoint`, `resolve_request_format`,
 * `auth_scheme`, `resolve_timeout_ms`) ONLY from the TOP LEVEL of the request
 * body. A nested `resolverContract: {...}` survives as dead metadata while the
 * record silently takes defaults — that is why metric-collector-vessel is
 * invisible. Every contract field below is flat.
 *
 * `systemVessel: true` is equally load-bearing: without it the record is
 * filtered out of org-scoped queries (registry.ts checks
 * `vessel.systemVessel === true || vessel.orgId === orgId`).
 *
 * Re-registration IS the heartbeat: the registry TTL is 5 minutes, so we
 * re-POST /register every 60s. Registration is non-blocking and non-fatal —
 * every error is swallowed and the interval is `.unref()`ed, so a discovery
 * outage never stops this vessel from serving.
