/**
 * The evidence ledger: what a walk actually put in the pool.
 *
 * Two rules are enforced here rather than in the components, because a rule
 * enforced in a component is a rule the next component forgets.
 *
 * 1. The empty-content case is a SEPARATE VARIANT, not a missing field.
 *    goal-host omits `contentPreview` and `truncated` entirely when an impulse
 *    carried nothing, so `entry.truncated === false` is never true for an empty
 *    impulse — it is `undefined`. Normalizing into a discriminated union makes
 *    the empty case impossible to render by accident as a blank content block.
 *
 * 2. Rendering dispatches on the FORM of the content, never on the shape name
 *    (rule P9). The registry advertises hundreds of shapes and the set is open
 *    and ragged — two live entries are entire prose sentences registered as
 *    shape names. Content, though, arrives in a small closed set of forms. The
 *    shape is a badge; the form drives the renderer; and the verbatim branch is
 *    the designed common case, not the error case.
 *
 * 3. The ENVELOPE PRE-PASS decides WHICH content is drawn, and it is therefore
 *    a transform here rather than a form. Making it a form would let a human
 *    pin `shellResult` to "envelope" and get a permanent double-render, and it
 *    would collide with the payload's own form; it has no renderer of its own,
 *    because its output is always some other form. Measured: three of three
 *    pool entries on each reached run arrived as a JSON OBJECT — most of them
 *    `{shape, stdout, stderr, exit_code}` — whose 33-line stdout rendered as
 *    one logical line of literal two-character `\n` sequences. The object is
 *    the single most common content form the pool produces and it had no
 *    branch anywhere.
