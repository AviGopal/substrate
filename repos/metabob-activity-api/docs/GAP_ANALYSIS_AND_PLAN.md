# Gap Analysis: Activity System Architecture vs Implementation

## Executive Summary

After inspecting the activity.metabob.com API (metabob-activity-api), we found that the **core infrastructure is well-implemented** but several learning features that are **tracked and stored are NOT used in recommendations**. This document identifies gaps and proposes fixes.

## Current State Assessment

### What's Working Well

| Component | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| **Thompson Sampling** | ✅ Excellent | Beta distribution via @stdlib, shape-conditioning, real-time computation from `v_activity_score` |
| **Shape-conditioned scores** | ✅ Excellent | `v_shape_conditioned_score` view with 3-tier matching (exact → subset → global) |
| **Execution traces** | ✅ Complete | Full `execution` table with input/output impulses, trace details |
| **Impulse storage** | ✅ Complete | `impulse` table with shapes, pointers, token estimates |
| **Composition tracking** | ✅ Complete | `activity_composition_graph` + `v_composition_graph` view |
| **Goal path tracking** | ✅ Complete | `goal_execution_paths` table with Thompson params |
| **Tool argument patterns** | ✅ Complete | `tool_argument_pattern` with success tracking, recommendations view |
| **Ribosome extraction** | ✅ Complete | `POST /v2/ribosome/extract` endpoint |
| **Heuristic boosts** | ✅ Complete | 8 boost categories in recommendation engine |

### Gaps Identified

| Gap ID | Description | Impact | Priority |
|--------|-------------|--------|----------|
| **GAP-01** | Composition graph not used in recommendations | Activities that succeed as children of current context aren't boosted | HIGH |
| **GAP-02** | Goal paths not used in recommendations | Proven paths for similar goals aren't suggested | HIGH |
| **GAP-03** | Heuristic boosts may overwhelm learning | ~22 points of boosts can overpower data-driven signal | MEDIUM |
| **GAP-04** | No activity seeding workflow | No structured way to bootstrap activities from heuristic chains | MEDIUM |
| **GAP-05** | Missing impulse tracking feedback | Input shapes tracked but not fed back to relevance scoring | LOW |

## Gap Details and Proposed Fixes

### GAP-01: Composition-Aware Recommendations

**Problem**: The `v_composition_graph` view tracks which activities succeed as children of other activities, but `POST /v2/activities/recommend` never queries this data.

**Example**: If "analyze-code" frequently calls "run-tests" successfully (weight=0.85), when recommending activities during an "analyze-code" execution, "run-tests" should be boosted.

**Current Code** (activities.ts ~2743-2870):
- Only uses: shape-conditioned scores, impulse relevancy, 8 heuristic boosts
- Does NOT query: `activity_composition_graph` or `v_composition_graph`

**Proposed Fix**:

```typescript
// In POST /v2/activities/recommend, after getting shape-conditioned scores:

// 9. Composition context boost (if parent_activity_id provided)
let compositionBoosts = new Map<string, number>();
if (parent_activity_id) {
  const compositionResult = await db.query(`
    SELECT child_activity_id, weight
    FROM v_composition_graph
    WHERE parent_activity_id = $parent
      AND org_id = $org
      AND execution_count >= 3
    ORDER BY weight DESC
    LIMIT 20
  `, { parent: parent_activity_id, org: orgId });

  for (const row of compositionResult) {
    // Convert weight (0-1) to boost (0-5)
    const boost = Math.floor(row.weight * 5);
    compositionBoosts.set(row.child_activity_id, boost);
  }
}

// Then in the boost calculation:
const compositionBoost = compositionBoosts.get(activityId) || 0;
totalBoost += compositionBoost;
```

**Schema Change**: Add `parent_activity_id` optional parameter to `ActivityRecommendRequestSchema`.

**Effort**: ~2-3 hours

### GAP-02: Goal Path Recommendations

**Problem**: `goal_execution_paths` stores successful activity sequences for goals with Thompson params, but `POST /v2/activities/recommend` doesn't suggest proven paths.

**Current API**: `POST /v2/activities/goal-paths/recommend` exists but is separate from main recommendations.

**Proposed Fix**: Integrate goal path data into main recommendations:

```typescript
// In POST /v2/activities/recommend, if task_description provided:

// 10. Goal path similarity boost
let goalPathBoosts = new Map<string, number>();
const similarGoals = await db.query(`
  SELECT path_activities, thompson_alpha, thompson_beta, success_rate
  FROM goal_execution_paths
  WHERE org_id = $org
    AND string::similarity::fuzzy(goal_text, $task) > 0.6
  ORDER BY success_rate DESC, total_executions DESC
  LIMIT 5
`, { org: orgId, task: task_description });

for (const goalPath of similarGoals) {
  // First activity in proven paths gets boost based on path success
  const firstActivity = goalPath.path_activities[0];
  if (firstActivity) {
    const existingBoost = goalPathBoosts.get(firstActivity) || 0;
    const pathBoost = Math.floor(goalPath.success_rate * 4); // 0-4 boost
    goalPathBoosts.set(firstActivity, Math.max(existingBoost, pathBoost));
  }
}
```

**Effort**: ~3-4 hours

---

### GAP-03: Heuristic Boost Calibration

**Problem**: Current boosts can add up to ~22-25 points:
- Tag match: +0 to +6
- Shape compatible: +3
- Recency: +1
- Execution history: +1 to +5
- Scope: +1
- Impulse relevancy: variable
- Category match: +3
- Output shape coverage: +0 to +4

With default alpha=1, beta=1, this means a new activity with all boosts gets alpha=24 before any real data.

**Impact**: Learning signal gets overwhelmed; activities don't need to prove themselves.

**Proposed Fix**: Scale boosts based on data confidence:

```typescript
// Scale boosts inversely with data confidence
const totalExecutions = (scores?.successes || 0) + (scores?.failures || 0);
const dataConfidence = Math.min(1.0, totalExecutions / 20); // Reaches 1.0 at 20 executions

// Apply diminishing boost scaling based on how much data we have
// With no data: full boost (let heuristics guide)
// With 20+ executions: minimal boost (let data speak)
const boostScale = 1.0 - (dataConfidence * 0.8); // Never fully zero out boosts

alpha += Math.floor(totalBoost * boostScale);
```

**Effort**: ~1 hour

### GAP-04: Activity Seeding Workflow

**Problem**: No structured way to bootstrap the activity network with heuristic chains.

**Current State**:
- Ribosome extracts templates from successful executions
- No way to seed "untested but plausible" activity chains

**Proposed Solution**: Add `/v2/activities/seed-chain` endpoint:

```typescript
// POST /v2/activities/seed-chain
// Creates a sequence of related activities with initial heuristic weights

interface SeedChainRequest {
  goal_category: 'feature' | 'bugfix' | 'refactor' | 'tool';
  chain_name: string;
  activities: Array<{
    name: string;
    description: string;
    input_shapes: string[];
    output_shapes: string[];
    tasks: ActivityTask[];
    initial_alpha?: number; // Heuristic prior (default: 2)
  }>;
  // Register as goal path with initial optimistic scores
  register_goal_path?: boolean;
}
```

**Use Case**: Seed "feature development" chain: analyze-requirements → design-solution → implement-code → write-tests → document-changes

**Effort**: ~4-6 hours

---

### GAP-05: Impulse Relevance Feedback Loop

**Problem**: `impulse_usage_history` and `impulse_relevance_metrics` track which impulses helped, but this data isn't systematically fed back.

**Current State**:
- `calculateImpulseRelevancyBoosts()` does query some relevance data
- But tracked data includes success/fail correlation that isn't fully used

**Proposed Fix**: Enhance impulse relevance computation:

```typescript
// Current: Simple presence-based boost
// Proposed: Bayesian P(success|impulse_loaded) vs P(success|not_loaded)

async function calculateImpulseRelevancyBoosts(
  activityIds: string[],
  loadedImpulses: string[]
): Promise<Map<string, ImpulseBoost>> {

  // Query actual relevance metrics
  const metrics = await db.query(`
    SELECT
      activity_variant_id,
      impulse_id,
      times_execution_succeeded,
      times_execution_failed,
      times_not_loaded_succeeded,
      times_not_loaded_failed,
      relevance_score  -- P(success | loaded)
    FROM impulse_relevance_metrics
    WHERE activity_variant_id IN $activities
  `, { activities: activityIds });

  // Calculate lift: P(success|loaded) / P(success|not_loaded)
  for (const m of metrics) {
    const pSuccessLoaded = m.times_execution_succeeded /
      (m.times_execution_succeeded + m.times_execution_failed + 1);
    const pSuccessNotLoaded = m.times_not_loaded_succeeded /
      (m.times_not_loaded_succeeded + m.times_not_loaded_failed + 1);

    const lift = pSuccessLoaded / (pSuccessNotLoaded + 0.001);
    // lift > 1 means impulse helps; < 1 means it hurts
  }
}
```

**Effort**: ~2-3 hours

## Verification Plan

After implementing Phase 1:

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test composition boost calculation
   - Test goal path similarity matching
   - Test boost scaling

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Verify recommendations change when `parent_activity_id` provided
   - Verify proven goal paths boost first activities

3. **Observability**:
   - Add `composition_boost` and `goal_path_boost` to `boost_breakdown` in response
   - Log when composition/goal path data influences selection

4. **Dashboard**:
   - Show composition edges in template detail view
   - Show goal paths that include each template

## Files to Modify

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `src/routes/activities.ts` | Add composition/goal path queries to recommend endpoint |
| `src/models/schemas.ts` | Add `parent_activity_id` to ActivityRecommendRequestSchema |
| `src/db/paradigm.ts` | Add helper functions for composition and goal path queries |
| `src/routes/activities.test.ts` | Add tests for new boost calculations |

---

## Conclusion

The infrastructure for composition-aware and goal-aware learning **already exists** in the database. The gap is purely in the recommendation engine not utilizing this data. Phase 1 can be completed quickly with high impact.

The heuristic boost calibration (GAP-03) is a more subtle issue that may require experimentation to tune properly. The activity seeding workflow (GAP-04) is valuable for bootstrapping but lower priority than fixing the learning signal.
