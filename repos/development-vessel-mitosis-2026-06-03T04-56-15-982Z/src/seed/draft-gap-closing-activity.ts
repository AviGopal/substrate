const PROMPT_TEMPLATE = `You are helping build a self-improving activity system.

Below is a failure-mode scenario that the system currently cannot handle autonomously
(emergence_class="gap"). Your task is to draft a candidate activity template (JSON) that,
if executed by the system, would produce the evidence or trace needed to close this gap.

## Substrate Memory — concepts already accumulated

These are concepts the substrate has learned from prior runs. Each entry shows the
shape, summary, success/load counts, and Bayesian relevance. Concepts with high
times_loaded and high relevance describe shape signatures the substrate has seen
repeatedly succeed. Treat them as priors: prefer drafting activities whose tasks
produce shapes the substrate already recognises, and re-use resolver chains that
mirror the high-relevance signatures below.

{{prime_substrate_concepts_text}}

## Substrate Memory — co-occurrence edges

Edges between impulse-signature concepts that have appeared together in successful
traces. Each edge's weight is the joint observation count. Use them to anticipate
which downstream shapes are likely to be needed once a given shape is produced.

### RESOLVER RULES (violations cause runtime failures — follow exactly)

1. Use ONLY these resolver names: fs_read, fs_write, llm_completion_dispatch, json_path_extract, http_fetch.

2. fs_read config: { "type": "fs_read", "path": "<ABSOLUTE path to a file that EXISTS>" }
   ONLY read these paths — they are guaranteed to exist:
   - /workspace/validation/failure-modes/scenarios/<scenario_id>.json  (the scenario file)
   - /workspace/validation/results/latest-failure-mode-report.json     (harness results)
   - /workspace/proposals/<any-file>.json                               (output dir)
   DO NOT invent paths like /var/traces/ or /analytics/ — they do not exist.
   DO NOT use fs_read to read directories — only read files with known full paths.

3. fs_write config: { "type": "fs_write", "path": "/workspace/proposals/<filename>.json", "content": "<content>" }
   Only write to /workspace/proposals/ or /workspace/gaps/.

4. llm_completion_dispatch config MUST use EXACTLY these fields:
   { "type": "llm_completion_dispatch", "prompt": "<prompt text>",
     "model": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5-20251001", "max_tokens": 1000 }
   NO other fields. "prompt_template", "system_prompt", "system" are NOT valid.

5. json_path_extract: DO NOT USE in your template. It is too fragile. Use llm_completion_dispatch to process any JSON data instead.

6. http_fetch config: { "type": "http_fetch", "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8080/...", "method": "GET" }
   Use to query activity-api for execution trace data (DO NOT read traces from files):
   - GET http://127.0.0.1:8080/v2/activities/execution-traces?limit=20
   - POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/v2/activities/discover-by-shapes with body

   For substrate writes, use http_fetch to POST to:
   - concept_create_write: POST http://127.0.0.1:8260/v2/impulses/resolve
     body: {"impulse":{"pointer":{"type":"concept_create_write","conceptData":{"shape":"<name>","source_type":"extracted","summary":"<text>","content":"<text>","priority":0.5,"budget":2000}}}}
   - substrateGap_write: POST http://127.0.0.1:8270/v2/impulses/resolve
     body: {"impulse":{"pointer":{"type":"substrateGap_write","gap":{"id":"<key>","category":"missing_concept","source":"substrate_detected","summary":"<text>","detected_at":"<ISO>","status":"open"}}}}

### TEMPLATE STRUCTURE RULES

7. The template must have: id, name, description, tags (array of strings), outputShapes, tasks[].
8. Each task must have: id, description, resolver, config.
9. Output ONLY valid JSON — no markdown fences, no prose before or after.
10. Template id must start with "gap-closing:" followed by the scenario id.
11. outputShapes must include the shapes from expected_emergence.activity_signature.output_shapes_must_include.

### STRUCTURED LEARNING (mandatory side-effect — knowledge dies otherwise)

Drafting a template is the primary output. The substrate also needs you to
RECORD what you learned about WHY this gap exists, so the next drafter run
inherits your reasoning. Autonomous-authoring templates that don't mint
side-effect concepts let knowledge die at execution boundaries — every
future LLM hop has to re-derive the same insight from scratch.

This is separate from the template JSON above; a separate dispatch task
will ask you for a short JSON object with the schema:
  { "shape": "<snake_case_shape_name>",
    "summary": "<one-line gist (<= 120 chars)>",
    "content": "<2-4 sentence explanation citing the scenario_id and the
                substrate concept ids that informed your draft>" }
If the gap is trivial and there is no substantive pattern worth recording,
return: { "shape": "trivial_gap", "summary": "no substrate learning", "content": "trivial" }
NEVER return null or empty — always emit a valid object.

### MANDATORY TEMPLATE STRUCTURE — use EXACTLY 4 tasks in this order

Your template MUST have exactly these 4 tasks and no others:

TASK 1 - read_scenario (fs_read):
  config: { "type": "fs_read", "path": "/workspace/validation/failure-modes/scenarios/<scenario_id>.json" }
  Replace <scenario_id> with the actual scenario_id from the failure-mode scenario above.

TASK 2 - fetch_traces (http_fetch):
  config: { "type": "http_fetch", "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8080/v2/activities/execution-traces?limit=20", "method": "GET" }
  This is the ONLY valid URL for execution traces. Do NOT invent other URLs.

TASK 3 - analyze (llm_completion_dispatch):
  config: {
    "type": "llm_completion_dispatch",
    "prompt": "Scenario: {{read_scenario_content}}\n\nRecent traces: {{fetch_traces_content}}\n\nAnalyze the failure mode described in the scenario against the recent traces. Produce a JSON report addressing the gap: {\"<output_shape_name>\": \"<your analysis>\"}",
    "model": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5-20251001",
    "max_tokens": 1000
  }
  Replace <output_shape_name> with the first shape from expected_emergence.activity_signature.output_shapes_must_include.

TASK 4 - write_report (fs_write):
  config: { "type": "fs_write", "path": "/workspace/proposals/<scenario_id>-report.json", "content": "{{analyze_text}}" }
  Replace <scenario_id> with the actual scenario id.

Respond with the JSON template only.`;
