 * Spec: openspec/changes/2026-06-01-obsidian-observe-and-experiment/
 *   specs/obsidian-observation-layer/spec.md §"observe-obsidian-events activity contract"
 *
 * Infrastructure activity. The runtime resolver lives in `obsidian-vessel`
 * (`src/resolvers/observe-obsidian-events.ts`) and is bootstrapped from the
 * Obsidian plugin's `main.ts`. This seed template makes that resolver
 * discoverable + dispatchable from activity-api so Phase 2/3 templates can
 * compose it.
 *
 * The activity itself is "drain the in-memory event log": it issues an
 * `http_fetch` against obsidian-vessel's events endpoint and returns the
 * recent obsidianEvent set as JSON. Per spec, every emitted impulse carries
 * `bridge_eligibility: "deny"` and `payload_hash` only — NO raw editor
 * text, NO absolute filesystem paths.
 *
 * No LLM tasks. Phase 1 is deterministic.
